# Password-Generator
This is a password generator program that lets you choose the length of the password and you can request as many passwords as you need. The password can be made up of characters (both uppercase and lower), numbers (0-9), and valid symbols ONLY. The program returns a string password after finding the valid date from the lists and strings that the characters are being stored in by iterating through.
